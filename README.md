## Getting Started

First you need to install [PNGwriter](https://github.com/pngwriter/pngwriter) on your computer by following [this guide](https://github.com/pngwriter/pngwriter#installation).
You might need to install `libpng-dev`, `zlib1g-dev`, `libbz2-1.0` and `libbz2-dev` beforehand.

Then, to compile the project, use the following command:

```bash
make
```

If you want to compile it under a specific build type, you can use one of the following:

```bash
make compile CMAKE_BUILT_TYPE=Debug
make compile CMAKE_BUILT_TYPE=Release
```

The defaults build type is `Release`.

---

Finally, to launch the built executable, use either `make run` or `./build/dna-not-ascii`.
